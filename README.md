## üìñ About

**Oxidoc** is a Rust-native library and CLI tool for converting diverse file formats into **JSONL** or **TXT** ‚Äî optimized for **AI training** and data preprocessing.

It draws inspiration from tools like Docling, but is built entirely in Rust, focusing on speed, safety, and flexibility.
